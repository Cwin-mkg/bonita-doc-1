## How do I create a Bonita application?

Thanks to the low-code Bonita platform you won't need to write a lot of code to create an application. Creation of Bonita applications relies heavily on models: a process model (using BPMN standard), a data model for business data management, a WYSIWYG tool for user interface design, and more.

Creating an application in Bonita Studio (the Bonita development environment) requires the following steps:
- graphically design one or several processes using BPMN notation
- define the data model using the Bonita Business Data Management feature (you can of course use your own database if needed)
- create web user interfaces using the Bonita UI Designer (or your preferred web framework)
- define users involved in the process
- configure connectors to integrate Bonita with the information system (e.g. to send an email, call a web service, and more.)

We will cover these steps in this getting started tutorial so you can get familiar with the concepts behind a Bonita application.
